Srabble Player (Created by Vidur Subaiah) ==>

One of the best ways to improve as a Scrabble player is to memorize all the letter words allowed during game play.  It should be noted that many of the world's best Scrabble players consider it is a waste of time (and brain power) to memorize the definitions of these words.

In Scrabble, the score of a word is the calculated by summing the point value
of each individual letter. The point value of each letter is assigned based 
on the frequency of the letters in the game. Common letters in English words 
have a lower score, (eg. c=3, a=1, t=1). Less common letters have a higher 
point value (eg. z=10, q=10, x=8)

The following are examples of words and their score:

   `cat` has a point value of 5 where c=3 + a=1 + t=1

   `tax` has a point value of 10, where t=1 + a=1 + x=8

This scrabble player allows you to win at any game of scrabble by providing you with a sorted list of all legal scrabble words and their scores based on the letters in your rack. These words and scores are pulled from an extensive list of legal words that has been compiled over the years.
